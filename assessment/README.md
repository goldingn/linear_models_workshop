## Assessment task for EE linear models course

### The data

This data set contains rent data from 2000-2018 in two regions of Melbourne: South Eastern Melbourne and North Western Melbourne.

The data set has several columns:

- discrict: where in Melbourne is this?
- area: local area (broadly, suburb)
- mon: month of observation 
- yr: year of observation
- variable: what was measured?
- value: actual rent in AUD
- property: property type
- mon_num: monthly quarter as an integer (3, 6, 9, 12)
- yr_mon: adjusted year to reflect monthly quarter
- yr_mar: year
- time: standardised value of yr_mon (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1)
- price: standardised value of rent (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1)


### The challenge

It's undeniable that rents increased between 2000 and 2018. But would you have been better off in the South East or North West of Melbourne? We want you to build a model that answers this question.

#### The rules

- You have 45 minutes.
- Work in groups of no more than 5 people.
- You're free to use any approaches you'd like, but we need to be convinced that your conclusion is robust and reliable.
- We want a definitive answer to our question.
